Using sales data from Charlotte Chaze, the below SQL code queries a database with multiple tables to gather statistics about customer and order data.

--How many orders were placed in January? 9723
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--Question 2: How many orders were for an iPhone? 379
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum as Customer_Account_Number
FROM customers
JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id=febsales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? AAA Batteries 4 pack - 2.99
SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT product, (price*quantity) as Total_Revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product


--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Quantity, (quantity*price) as Total_Revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct customers.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales
JOIN customers
ON Febsales.orderid=customers.order_id
Where FebSales.Quantity>2
AND length(orderID)=6
And orderid <> 'Order ID'

--List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, sum(quantity)
FROM FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product

--Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).
SELECT location, sum(quantity)
FROM JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING sum(quantity)>2

---How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT product, sum(quantity)
FROM febsales
WHERE product like '%headphone%'
GROUP BY Product


--What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)
SELECT sum (price*quantity)/count(customers.acctnum)
FROM febsales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON febsales.orderID=customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
SELECT sum (quantity)/count(customers.acctnum)
FROM febsales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON febsales.orderID=customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT Product, sum(price*quantity)
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY sum(price*quantity) desc
LIMIT 1
