Using sales data from Charlotte Chaze, the below SQL code queries a database with multiple tables to gather statistics about customer and order data.

--How many orders were placed in January? 9723
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--Question 2: How many orders were for an iPhone? 379
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum as Customer_Account_Number
FROM customers
JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id=febsales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? AAA Batteries 4 pack - 2.99
SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT product, (price*quantity) as Total_Revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product


--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Quantity, (quantity*price) as Total_Revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct customers.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales
JOIN customers
ON Febsales.orderid=customers.order_id
Where FebSales.Quantity>2
AND length(orderID)=6
And orderid <> 'Order ID'
