# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

SELECT * from Spotifydata

--Identify top 10 songs (by popularity). Observe if there are any similarities in danceability, energy or tempo.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity, danceability, energy, tempo
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

--See how many songs in the top 100 by artist, sort by number of songs on list
SELECT artist_name, count(*) as Number_of_hits
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY number_of_hits desc

--Is there a trend between danceability and energy? (Sort by danceability and see if energy trends as well)
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability, energy
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc

--What is the average danceability by artist and track
SELECT artist_name, sum(danceability)/count(artist_name) AS Average_Danceability
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name

--What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1

--What is the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT avg(danceability)as 'AVG Danceability of top 12'
FROM spotifydata
WHERE (SELECT popularity FROM spotifydata ORDER BY popularity desc limit 12)
