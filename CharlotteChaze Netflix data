In this SQL code, I am querying a database from Charlotte Chaze that holds Netflix data to answer questions about the data.

/*This first code linked the two databases together*/
SELECT p.show_id, t.title, t.rating, p.director 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" P
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" T
ON P.show_id=t.show_id;

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
SELECT Count(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 
SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT TITLE
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 
SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star'

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 
SELECT title, date_added, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type ='Movie'
ORDER BY date_added asc
Limit 1;
